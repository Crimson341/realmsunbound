# Pricing Strategy & Structure for Realms

**Goal:** Monetize specialized AI features (Image Gen, Long-term Memory, Advanced Models) while keeping the core "play" experience accessible to build a large user base.

## 1. Pricing Tiers

### **Tier 1: Wanderer (Free)**
*Target: Casual players, testers, and friends joining campaigns.*
*   **Price:** $0 / month
*   **Campaigns:** Join unlimited public campaigns.
*   **Characters:** Create up to 3 characters.
*   **AI Model:** Gemini Flash (Fast, efficient, good for standard play).
*   **Memory:** Short-term only (Last 20 messages). No persistent vector memory.
*   **Images:** View existing images only. No generation.
*   **Access:** Public Library (Spells/Items).

### **Tier 2: Hero (Pro)**
*Target: The core "Player" & "Light DM". People who want their own private world.*
*   **Price:** $9.99 / month
*   **Campaigns:** Create 3 Custom Campaigns (Private).
*   **Characters:** Unlimited.
*   **AI Model:** Gemini Flash (Standard) with Priority Processing.
*   **Memory:** **Smart Memory** (Vector Search enabled). The AI remembers your adventures, NPCs, and key plot points forever.
*   **Images:** 50 AI Image Generations / month (Character portraits, item icons).
*   **Features:**
    *   Private Campaigns (Invite only).
    *   Custom Item Creation.

### **Tier 3: Legend (Dungeon Master)**
*Target: Power users, Streamers, and Professional DMs.*
*   **Price:** $19.99 / month
*   **Campaigns:** Unlimited Custom Campaigns.
*   **AI Model:** **Gemini Pro 1.5** (Smarter, more creative, handles complex logic better).
*   **Memory:** Enhanced Smart Memory (Larger context window, deeper recall).
*   **Images:** **Unlimited** AI Image Generations.
*   **Features:**
    *   **World Building Tools:** AI-assisted generation of entire towns, histories, and factions in one click.
    *   **Commercial Rights:** Own the text/images generated for your campaigns (great for streamers/podcasts).
    *   **Export:** Export campaign data to JSON/PDF.
    *   **Custom Personas:** Train the AI to speak like specific authors or styles (e.g., "Eldritch Horror", "High Fantasy").

## 2. Add-ons (Micro-transactions)
*   **Token Packs ($4.99):** 100 Extra Image Credits (for Heroes who run out).
*   **Booster Packs ($2.99):** Unlocks a premium "Campaign Template" (e.g., "Cyberpunk 2077 Style" with pre-made assets, sounds, and rules).

## 3. Enterprise / API Access
*   *Future consideration for game studios wanting to use the Realms engine.*

## 4. Psychology & Design Notes
*   **"Anchoring":** The $19.99 plan makes the $9.99 plan look like a "no-brainer" deal.
*   **"Loss Aversion":** The Free tier has no long-term memory. Players who get attached to their story will upgrade to "Hero" just to ensure the AI remembers their character's backstory.
*   **"Visual Reward":** Locking Image Generation behind a paywall is a strong visual motivator. Users see cool AI art on the landing page and want to make their own.
